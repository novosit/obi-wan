# Challenge No. 03 - Weekly Payments

Open the `js_html/index.html`  file to start the application with either Google Chrome or Firefox (won't work on IE). The interface is intuitive enough not to require any instructions on how to use.

This is a SPA-styled solution that's built on:
* HTML5 Boilerplate as starting point (https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* Bootstrap 3 CSS framework for styling (https://getbootstrap.com)
* AngularJS MV* framework for the UI

The files that were coded to make this application work and that need to be reviewed are:
        
        /js_html
        |	index.html
        |	reports.html
        |-- /js
        |   |-- /app
        |   |   |       app.js
        |   |   |--     /controllers
        |   |   |		EmployeeController.js
        |   |   |		ReportController.js
        |   |   |--     /models
        |   |   |		Report.js
        |   |   |--     /services
        |   |   |		ApiService.js
        |   |   |		ResourceService.js
        |   |   |		StorageService.js
        |   |   |		YahooService.js
